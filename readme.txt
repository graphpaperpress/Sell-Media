== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you help me set up this plugin? =

If you're having trouble getting things set up, we offer a hosted version of Sell Media through our [VisualSociety.com](https://visualsociety.com) platform. There are many additional features found at VisualSociety.com.

= Can I sell photo prints in addition to downloads? =

Yes, there are two ways to do this: 1) [VisualSociety.com](https://visualsociety.com) includes print fulfillment by the world's best photo printers. 2) The [Reprints extension](https://graphpaperpress.com/plugins/sell-media-reprints/) allows you to sell prints, but you are responsible for fulfilling the order. Both you and the customer will receive an email when an order is placed.

= I have 5k+ photos I would like to sell, can Sell Media handle this? =

Sell Media is a plugin for WordPress and WordPress can easily handle hundreds or thousands of files. That said, the number of images that can be bulk uploaded at once is largely related to server performance. If you are using a cheap, shared web host, then you will need to contact them and ask them to change [PHP settings] (http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php).

= What are shortcodes and how do I use them? =

Shortcodes are small snippets of code that when added to a Post, Page or Widget add functionality to your site. You must add the following shortcodes to your preferred Pages to use Sell Media:

* **Checkout Shortcode** - (REQUIRED) Create a page called "Checkout" and add this shortcode to it: `[sell_media_checkout]`
* **Thanks Shortcode** - (REQUIRED) Create a page called "Thanks" and add this shortcode to it: `[sell_media_thanks]`
* **Buy Button Shortcode** - (OPTIONAL) Used for displaying specific items for sale: `[sell_media_item id="1893" text="Purchase" style="button" size="medium"]` Options include: text="purchase | buy" style="button | text" size="thumbnail | medium | large" align="left | center | right"
* **Search Form Shortcode** - (OPTIONAL) Used to display a search form exclusively for searching items for sale within Sell Media: `[sell_media_searchform]`
* **All items shortcode** - (OPTIONAL) Displays all (or a certain collection) items in a grid view: `[sell_media_all_items collection="type-your-collection-slug-here" show="type-number-of-items-per-page"]`
* **Download list shortcode** - (OPTIONAL) List logged in users downloads: `[sell_media_download_list]`
* **Lightbox shortcode** - (OPTIONAL) Displays a page containing all items that visitors have added to their lightbox: `[sell_media_lightbox]`
* **Login shortcode** – (OPTIONAL) Used to show a custom login form for your customers: `[sell_media_login_form]`
* **Filters shortcode** – (OPTIONAL) Used to show a page with Latest, Most Popular, Collections, and Keywords as filters: `[sell_media_filters filters="all"]` You can also pass 1, 2, 3, 4 into the filters shortcode parameter to only show specific tabs Latest (1), Most Popular (2), Collections (3),  or Keywords (4). For example, if you only wanted to show the Latest and Keywords tabs, you would use this shortcode: `[sell_media_filters filters="1,4"]`

= How do I show my checkout cart? =

1. Create a page called "Checkout" and add this shortcode to the page: `[sell_media_checkout]`
2. Visit Sell Media -> Settings and select the Checkout page you created above to the "Checkout Page" option.

= How do I show an item available for sale? =

Visit the Sell Media -> Add Product page and configure the page options. Click Save. Then click the View Product link.

= How do I show a search form for Sell Media items? =

Create a Page called "Search Media" and add this shortcode to it: `[sell_media_searchform]`. A search form also shows up above archive pages for products.

= Can I sell image galleries? =

Yes and you have two options:

1. Simply upload more than one image on the Sell Media -> Add New page. The price listed below is for each image in the gallery. In the near future, we will be releasing an extension for selling the entire gallery of images for one price.
2. Assign each item to a specific Collection and the items will be displayed on that specific collection's archive page. You can then link to the collection like this: http://example.com/collection/my-collection-name/. A list of collecitons also shows up on the Appearance -> Menus page so you can add them to any menu.

= How do I password protect an item? =

The Password Protection option is located in the Publish box when editing a Sell Media item. Click the Visibility - Public - Edit link, select Password Protected, type in a password and click Save.

= How do I password protect a collection? =

Click Sell Media -> Collections -> Click "Edit" next to the Collection you want to hide, fill in the "Password" click update.

= How do I hide a collection from being listed on archive pages? =

Click Sell Media -> Collections -> Add New and check the "Hide" option.

= Payments aren't showing up in Sell Media. Why? =

Please visit the Add Media -> Settings -> Payments page and double check all of your settings.

If you're still having issues, [check these tips in the PayPal section](https://graphpaperpress.com/docs/sell-media/#paypal).

= My file is 500MB+ in size but users cannot download the file after purchasing? =

Check with your hosting provide on your download limits. Sell Media does not provide any type of file splitting service.

We do offer an Amazon S3 extension which offloads to storage of all uploads, which might be useful: [View the extensions](http://graphpaperpress.com/downloads/category/extensions/).

= How do I increase the maximum upload size in WordPress? =

Depending on the web hosting company you choose and the package you select, each of you will see maximum file upload limit on your Media Uploader page in WordPress. For some it is as low as 2MB which is clearly not enough for large images or videos. You can increase this by doing one of the following:

1. Theme Functions File - There are cases where we have seen that just by adding the following code in the theme function's file, you can increase the upload size:

    `@ini_set( 'upload_max_size', '64M' );
    @ini_set( 'post_max_size', '64M');
    @ini_set( 'max_execution_time', '300' );`

2. Create or Edit an existing PHP.INI file - In most cases if you are on a shared host, you will not see a php.ini file in your directory. If you do not see one, then create a file called php.ini and upload it in the root folder. In that file add the following code:

    `upload_max_filesize = 64M
    post_max_size = 64M
    max_execution_time = 300`

3. htaccess Method - Some people have tried using the htaccess method where by modifying the .htaccess file in the root directory, you can increase the maximum upload size in WordPress. Open or create the .htaccess file in the root folder and add the following code:

    `php_value upload_max_filesize 64M
    php_value post_max_size 64M
    php_value max_execution_time 300
    php_value max_input_time 300`

Again, it is important that we emphasize that if you are on a shared hosting package, these techniques may not work. In that case, you would have to contact your web hosting provider to increase the limit for you.

= What are license types? =

The Sell Media plugin helps you to create and assign different licenses and prices for each image, video or audio file based on the anticipated usage of the media. For example: If a large company wants to purchase one of your images for a billboard, you should charge one price for commercial usage, charge another for editorial, and so on.

= Does the plugin work for a WordPress Network =

Yes.

= My customer is receiving their confirmation email X many times? =

Please disable your plugins and see if you still have the issue. Some plugins (ones that alter access via IP) do not allow the IPN to function properly.
