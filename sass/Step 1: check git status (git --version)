How to clone a specific branch in git
GIT
In general:

git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>

Example:

git clone -b "sell-media-stripe-dev" https://ashok_ladumor@bitbucket.org/graphpaperpress/sell-media-stripe.git



When creating a Sell Media Item,  in the Advanced tab, you can create a Creator and select it. Once that is done and you save the post, the post has the Creator selected but when you try to edit the individual images from the post, the image doesn't have the selected Creator. Thus, the "search" or clicking the on Creator link from All Products page doesn't show any results.

Reprints Extension - On Checkout page, I see "Shipping Process" link in checkout form. This is confusing, and it's blank popup. Only show if user has added shipping process text on Settings. Also, move it below the checkout form entirely.

Core - Add to Cart button. After clicking Add to Cart button, a new link shows up below to take buyer to checkout. It would be better to just change the text and link of the Add to Cart button from Add to Cart to Checkout Now.


the post has the Creator selected but when you try to edit the individual images from the post

1. Assign creator to individule image from product edit page.
2. Disable Shipping Process popup when it have no content. Moved it below the checkout form entirely.
3. Changed the text and link of the Add to Cart button from Add to Cart to Checkout Now.

git push origin "sell-media-reprints-dev"
